# It's easy to create a variable in Python.
n = 3
print(n)
print(n + 3.1)
print(n + n)
print(pow(n, n))  # "pow" is a Python built-in function: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html

print()

#Â Variables can be re-assigned in Python.
# Some languages require reused variables to keep the same type (for example, integer, floating point, or string).
# Python does not have this requirement. Here, we reassign "n" from an integer to a string:
n = 'Create'
print(n)

Radioactive source term estimation is applicable to domains ranging from disaster response to nuclear monitoring. While robotic inspectors have been proposed, and in some cases deployed, for this task in certain nuclear applications, deployment in verification contexts &ndash; where privacy concerns are of the utmost importance &ndash; has not been addressed. Such applications impose strict constraints on sensors and stored information due to the potentially secret nature of observable features in the inspected site. One verification scheme, which avoids direct observation of sensitive items, is to confirm the absence of radioactive sources; however, this has not yet been adapted to the field of robotics. We propose a minimally-intrusive verification procedure that confirms the absence of sources without requiring, nor providing, any information about the search environment. The privacy and correctness of our random walk-based approach are validated by extensive simulated and experimental demonstrations.

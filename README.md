Radioactive source term estimation is applicable to domains ranging from disaster response to nuclear monitoring. Robotic inspectors have been proposed, and in some cases deployed, for this task in certain applications; however, they have not been actively considered in nuclear verification contexts where privacy concerns are of the utmost importance. There are strict constraints on sensors and stored information due to the potentially secret nature of observable features in inspected sites. Confirming the absence of radioactive sources avoids direct observation of sensitive items, but this task has not yet been implemented with a robotic inspector. We propose a minimally-intrusive robotic verification procedure that confirms the absence of radioactive sources without requiring, nor providing, any information about the search environment. We provide theoretical guarantees on the privacy and correctness of our random walk-based approach, which are validated by extensive simulated and experimental demonstrations.

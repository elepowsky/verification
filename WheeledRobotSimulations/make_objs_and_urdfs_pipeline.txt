# How to construct new environments for the source detection problem

Requirements: 
	(I) Slide-making application that can export as image (e.g., Impress, Keynote, PowerPoint)
	(II) potrace and blender applications (linux: use apt package manager) -- for .pbm conversion
	(III) object2urdf pip package -- for URDF generation

(1) Format the environment as a single slide in a presentation-making app (e.g., Keynote, Impress, PowerPoint)

(2) Convert the slide to portable bitmap (.pbm) format
	(2a) Export to preferred image style (e.g., png, jpeg, etc)
	(2b) Convert to bitmap (.bmp)
	(2c) Use potrace to convert .bmp to .pbm (portable bitmap) [convert filename.bmp filename.pbm]

(3) Convert to environment object using blender
	(3a) Place in blender folder
	(3b) Use the command blender --background --python pbm_to_obj.py

(4) Create URDF [follow guidelines from README.md at https://github.com/harvard-microrobotics/object2urdf/tree/master]
	(4a) make subdirectories under todo/ for each object (e.g., Room6/ Room7/ ...)
	(4b) place .obj and .mtl files into appropriate subdirectories 
	(4c) navigate to parent directory of todo/
	(4d) run python3 build_room_urdfs.py
	(4e) move all urdfs and associated subfolders from todo/ to done/ (LEAVE _prototype.urdf in todo/!!!)

(5) Move URDF files and update configurations
	(5a) Add .yml file to pybullet/configuration/scenarios (can copy from Room1.yml; just change the name field and any other desired parameters)
	(5b) Update help argument of ArgumentParser in main script (Room1-N)
	(5c) navigate to pybullet/models/scenes/ and mkdir RoomK, cd RoomK
	(5d) cp RoomK.urdf, RoomK.pbm to .../scenes/RoomK
	(5e) mkdir RoomK inside initial RoomK and navigate to it (i.e., mkdir .../models/scenes/RoomK/RoomK; cd .../models/scenes/RoomK/RoomK)
	(5f) cp RoomK.obj AND RoomK_vhacd.obj from the output of Step 4 into this folder
